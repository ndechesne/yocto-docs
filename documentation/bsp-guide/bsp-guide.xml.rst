Yocto Project Board Support Package Developer's Guide
=====================================================

.. note:: This version of the **Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP)
          Developer's Guide** is for the &YOCTO_DOC_VERSION; release of the
          Yocto Project. To be sure you have the latest version of the manual
          for this release, go to the <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_URL;'>Yocto
          Project documentation page</ulink> and select the manual from that
          site. Manuals from the site are more up-to-date than manuals derived
          from the Yocto Project released TAR files.

.. note:: If you located this manual through a web search, the version of the
          manual might not be the one you want (e.g. the search might have
          returned a manual much older than the Yocto Project version with which
          you are working). You can see all Yocto Project major releases by
          visiting the <ulink
          url='&YOCTO_WIKI_URL;/wiki/Releases'>Releases</ulink> page. If you
          need a version of this manual for a different Yocto Project release,
          visit the <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_URL;'>Yocto Project documentation
          page</ulink> and select the manual set by using the "ACTIVE RELEASES
          DOCUMENTATION" or "DOCUMENTS ARCHIVE"
          pull-down menus.

.. note:: To report any inaccuracies or problems with this (or any other Yocto
          Project) manual, send an email to the Yocto Project documentation
